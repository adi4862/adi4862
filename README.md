## 🛠️ My Projects
### [Attendance monitoring system](https://github.com/adi4862/attendance-monitoring-system)
- Description: The project is a face recognition-based attendance monitoring system designed to detect and mark the live attendance of students.
It uses the Haar-cascade classifier algorithm for face detection and the LBPH (local binary pattern histogram) algorithm for face
recognition
- Technologies used: Python, OpenCV, Tkinter.
